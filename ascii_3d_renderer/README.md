# Ascii 3D Point Renderer
Fast? ❌ Efficient? ❌ Clean? ❌ Working? Barely😎

This is a simple little program that takes points on a 3D grid, and then renders and displays them with ascii characters. This has been my easter project, so i probably won't update it a lot unless i have major changes. My only goal with this project was to make a spinning cube, so that's where i stopped.

In the program there are some very useful functions you will probably need if you want to draw anything. The drawLine() function draws enough points between two points to make a line. This function is the basis of all shapes. There are also some functions for making cubes to save you some time. These cube functions take rotation as a parameter, which means that we can render multiple frames to make an animation, like shown in the code.

Example:
